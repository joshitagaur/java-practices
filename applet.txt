What is an applet ?
An applet is a java program and like other java programs it just can't execute on its own. It needs the support of JRE to execute.
The main difference between an applet and other java program is that in case of applet the JRE is provided by the browser plugin.
The browser which contains JRE as plugin is called as java enabled browser. Now a days all the browsers are java enabled.

Therefore we say that applet is a java program that needs to be embeded in an html document. When this html document is rendered by 
the java enabled, browser, then JRE plugin of the browser executes that java program.

Every applet is a public class created by extending the inbuilt class called as Applet.
The applet does not have any main() method. The life cycle of the applet contains the following five methods...
1. public void init();
2. public void start();
3. public void stop();
4. public void paint(Graphics g);
5. public void destroy();

init and destroy are called only for once in the entire lifecycle of the program. start, stop and paint() may get called several times
in the lifecycle of the applet.

If we don't have any java enabled browser, then their is a utility called as appletviewer which may be used to run the applet.
