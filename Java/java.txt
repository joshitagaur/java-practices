-> Private members are only accesible within class.
-> To differentiate private members from those defined inside a method we use the keyword this.
   for eg. Sharma ji ki guddan.
-> Constructer always exist.
-> Static is called before main.
-> Static is that thing that is common for all while interface is diff.
   for eg. in a class students have different bags, books, pen are diff for each student but blackboard is common for all
           therefore blackboard is static while books etc are interfaces.
-> to declare any method or variable static we put the keyword static before it.
